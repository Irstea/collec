# Update Collec-Science from version 23.0.0

## General principle

Until version 23.0.0, Collec-Science updates were based on this principle :

- retrieve the code in zipped form

- decompressing the file and renaming the generated folder

- copying parameters from the previous version

- repositioning of file access rights

- launch database modification scripts

From version 23.0.0 onwards, upgrading is recommended using *git*, which makes intermediate updates much simpler and faster.

## Upgrade mode migration code

Before executing the code, check the paths indicated.
